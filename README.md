# Bike-Sharing Demand Forecasting

## 📘 Overview
This project predicts hourly **bike rental demand** based on environmental and seasonal factors using **Machine Learning**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  

## 🧠 ML Workflow
1. Performed **data cleaning and feature engineering** on weather and usage data  
2. Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify seasonal and time-based trends  
3. Built and tuned **regression models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
4. Evaluated models using **RMSE, MAE, and R²** metrics  

## 📊 Outcome
The model accurately forecasts hourly demand, supporting **urban mobility and resource planning** with data-driven insights.
